Overview
  
  The shadow of fentanyl has cast a chilling darkness over the past decade in the United
  States, transforming the opioid crisis into a deadly tsunami. In 2013, fentanyl deaths
  were barely a blip, accounting for only 3% of opioid overdoses. Today, the picture is
  grim: a staggering 80% of opioid-related deaths involve fentanyl, claiming over 73,000
  lives in 2022 alone. This represents a 2,300% increase since 2013, a horrifying
  escalation reflecting the potent grip of this synthetic opioid.
  The crisis disproportionately impacts young adults, with those aged 18-45
  experiencing the highest fentanyl death rates. Tragically, lives cut short in their prime
  paint a painful picture of a generation grappling with the scourge of addiction.
